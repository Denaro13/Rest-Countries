### What I learned

This is a project that really challenged my understanding on how react router works and how to implement some of it features.
I am delighted to have tried working on this project.

### Continued development

My understanding of react router was tested in this project and despite the fact that I was able to work my way through getting the project done I still have some few aspect to work on and also improve my understanding on how to work with Json data.
